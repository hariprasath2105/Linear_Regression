# Student Score Predictor

A simple web application built with Python and Gradio that predicts a student's exam score based on the number of hours studied, using a **Linear Regression model**.

---

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use Linear Regression for predicting numerical outcomes. It takes input as **hours studied** and predicts the **score** using a pre-trained model (`model.pkl`) trained on a dataset of student scores.
